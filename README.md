# ShissuGuildTools

This is an update of the popular Shissu Guild Tools Addon. I was originally written by Christian Flory @Shissu for the EU server.

# Intent

Shissu Guild Tools has been updated by Splat and Sordrak on the ESOUI server. By creating a history of changes made Spalt, Sordrak, other authors, and even Shissu could contribute to this addon and share ideas to improve the tool. It is not intended to take ocer Spalt or Sordrak work. They are welcome to use the changes from this repository.

The only trace of a licence is in the header of the Lua files as shown below. I have contacted Shissu on ESOUI and am awaiting further clarification on what other licence he would like to see included with his mod.
